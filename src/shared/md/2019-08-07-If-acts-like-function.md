comma(,) is a **operator**. yes. it's nothing special.

`if` statement can contains your any `expression`, result is simple, last expression will be passed by comma operator.

but there is one difference, `if` statement will be evaluated as `Boolean`.

in fact, you can write comma operated expressions in any kind if you are wrapping with parentheses(`( expression )`) except `function`(you must wrap extra parentheses if you want to add comma operator).
